# Programming in Rust

This repository contains my implementation of the assignments for the Czech course "Programování v Rustu" (PvR) at
VŠB-TUO. The goal of the course was to learn the Rust programming language.

## Assignments

The repository is organized into weekly assignments, each focusing on specific topics in Rust. Directories with the
`-exercises` postfix contain preparatory materials for that week's assignment.

Please note: some assignments may be incomplete or contain errors.
