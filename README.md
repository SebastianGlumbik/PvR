# Programming in Rust

This repository contains my implementation of the assignments for the Czech
course ["Programování v Rustu" (PvR)](https://edison.sso.vsb.cz/cz.vsb.edison.edu.study.prepare.web/SubjectVersion.faces?version=460-4157/02&subjectBlockAssignmentId=545221&studyFormId=1&studyPlanId=26573&locale=en)
at VŠB-TUO. The goal of the course was to learn the Rust programming language.
